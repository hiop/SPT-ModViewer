  //	Every time the timer expires, the counters (items and categories) are reduced.
  //		Timer duration  is configured via the "decreaseOfPurchasePeriod" value.
  //		Counters reduced by percengate of their value. Percentage is configured via the "decreaseOfPurchasePeriod" value.
  // 	Counters of items and category here: "SPT/user/mods/DynamicFleaPrice/Data/DynamicFleaPriceData.json"
  
  // Percentage reduction of counters values
  // value range 1 - 100,

  // Explanation:
  //	Every time a flea market generates an offer, the price is multiplied by a certain value.
  // 	The multiplier value is calculated using the formula:
  // 	ITEM_MULTIPLIER + CATEGORY_MULTIPLIER
  //	
  // 	If the values in ("increaseMultiplierPerItem", "increaseMultiplierPerItemCategory") ​​are not configured,
  //	then the multiplier will always be equal to 1.
  
  // Price multiplier for each item purchased

	// Example:
	// Ammo category.
	// Let's assume all players is server purchased a total of 10,000 units of ammunition. 
	// Then, according to the multiplier formula, it will be:
	// 10 000 * 0.00065 = 6,5
	// The price for the next generated offers for ALL AMMO will be 6.5 times higher
